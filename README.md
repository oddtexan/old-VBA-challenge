# VBA-Challenge

# Please find attached, the SCREENSHOTS of results with names 2018.png, 2019.png and 2020.png AND SCRIPT FILE with the name Multiyear Stock Data.vb for the code.

## Purpose 
In this project we use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. We loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataset. 

### Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
- NOTE
  Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

#### Steps 
1. Set MainWs as a worksheet object variable.
2. We loop through all of the worksheets in the workbook after setting header info to find the last cell that is not empty.
3. After setting initial value of beginning stock value for the first Ticker, we continue to check if we are on the same ticker name, to establish the ticker name starting point to begin the calculations.
4. Lastly we print values based on the outcome of comparing the yearly price change percent.
